# Data Compression
The aim of this project is to compress binary data using Genetic Algorithms and Reversible Cellular Automata.
The code is written in Python, and the Python Notebooks has an explanation for how the algorithm works.
The GUI has been implemented with the help of [Tkinter.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html#module-Tkinter)

To run the program: 
`cd DataCompression && python gui.py`

Click on `Compress File` to choose your file, and `Decompress File` to decompress a file that has been compressed with this program.
